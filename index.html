              Manchester is a thriving city in North West England, known for its
              industrial past and nicknamed 'Cottonopolis'. However, the city
              has undergone successful regeneration projects and is now a major
              hub for culture and commerce. Manchester is often referred to as
              the capital of the north of England and is sometimes regarded as
              England's second city.
